# Buy-side equity analyst

An AI skill that runs fundamental equity research on a public company the way a buy-side analyst would, and ends with a capital allocation call rather than a description of the business.

It works through business model, moat, financial quality, management, valuation, risks and catalysts, then forces three things most write-ups skip: the strongest bear case, what the market already believes, and where that consensus might be wrong. Output is a fixed template ending in a probability-weighted view, a confidence score out of ten, and a position suitability call.

## Install

See [Install](../../README.md#install) in the main README. It works in any agent that reads skills folders. In a chat assistant without skills, paste this folder's `SKILL.md` (below the `---` header) into custom instructions or the first message.

## Using it

Name a company and ask for research:

```
Run a full buy-side workup on Costco.
```

The skill asks for evidence over narrative, so give it filings or financials if you have them rather than letting it work from memory.

## What it returns

Thesis in three to five bullets, moat rated weak/moderate/strong, financial and management assessment, valuation view, bear case, risks, catalysts by horizon, bull/base/bear scenarios, expected return and time horizon, confidence out of ten, and a final recommendation with position suitability.

## Part of a set

Four skills that split an investment committee across separate roles, so each argument gets made properly instead of one voice hedging against itself:

- [buy-side-equity-analyst](../buy-side-equity-analyst) — builds the case
- [chief-risk-officer](../chief-risk-officer) — attacks it
- [macro-analyst](../macro-analyst) — sets the regime
- [portfolio-manager](../portfolio-manager) — sizes the position

Run this one first, then hand its output to the risk officer.
