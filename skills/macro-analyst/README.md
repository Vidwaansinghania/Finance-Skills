# Macro analyst

An AI skill that classifies the current economic regime and translates it into portfolio positioning. It does not pick stocks.

The premise is that markets are regime-driven rather than narrative-driven, and that the same asset behaves differently depending on which regime you are in. So the skill sorts the environment into one of six states, from expansion through stagflation, reads the rate, inflation, growth, liquidity, credit and policy variables behind that call, and then works forward to sector leadership, growth versus value, small versus large cap, and what the portfolio is quietly exposed to. Scenarios get explicit probabilities rather than adjectives.

## Install

See [Install](../../README.md#install) in the main README. It works in any agent that reads skills folders. In a chat assistant without skills, paste this folder's `SKILL.md` (below the `---` header) into custom instructions or the first message.

## Using it

```
What regime are we in, and what does it mean for a portfolio tilted toward consumer discretionary?
```

Give it current rate and inflation data. A model's training data has a cutoff, so without fresh figures it reasons from stale numbers, which is the one failure mode this skill cannot catch on its own.

## What it returns

Current regime with a probability, key macro drivers broken out by variable, market implications across equities and sectors and factors, portfolio overweights and underweights with risks to current positioning, probabilities across soft landing, recession, re-acceleration and stagflation, and a final risk-on/neutral/risk-off verdict.

## Part of a set

Four skills that split an investment committee across separate roles, so each argument gets made properly instead of one voice hedging against itself:

- [buy-side-equity-analyst](../buy-side-equity-analyst) — builds the case
- [chief-risk-officer](../chief-risk-officer) — attacks it
- [macro-analyst](../macro-analyst) — sets the regime
- [portfolio-manager](../portfolio-manager) — sizes the position

This one runs independently of any single name. Use it to set context before the analyst starts, or to check what a portfolio is betting on without meaning to.
